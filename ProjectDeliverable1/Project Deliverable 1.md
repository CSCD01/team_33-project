# **Team 33 Deliverable 1**

## **Chosen Process**: Kanban Agile Process

## **Reasoning**:
1) Agile makes the most sense:

   The schedules of the team members is very volatile during the second half of the semester, so we need to be able to change requirements and expectations on the fly.

   Creating a plan for the next few days, up to a week, would not work well for us as it requires a level of dedication and time allocation that cannot be promised from university students in their last semester. So more flexibility is required.

   Reuse-oriented development processes also did not make much sense because the project is more or less done at this point, and is not created from existing components, and is not modularized itself. Using any process that is reuse-oriented would not work well at all really.

2) Kanban allows us to tailor the process to how we best operate:
   
   The practices of Kanban coincide well with how we usually work together as a group. The idea of visualizing the work is very helpful as most of are visually oriented, so being able to see what work is at what stage is a great boon to our productivity.
   
   Another practice is to limit the amount of work in progress, which is best for us, since everyone has a lot of work to do aside from this project, so limiting the amount of context switching we do, is best for the whole team.

   There is also a principle in Kanban to encourage leadership among everyone, which again works well for us, as we do not have defined roles for anyone in the group and it really is a collaborative effort with ideas welcome from everyone.

3) The down sides of agile do not really apply to us:
   
   * Difficult to keep the interest of customers: We have no customers
   * Team members may be unsuited to the intense involvement: This is where the kanban nature of our process comes into play, as people choose what they are most suited too, so we minimize how out-of-place people feel
   * Prioritising tasks is hard with multiple stakeholders: We don't really have any stakeholders other than the 4 members
   * Simplicity is hard to maintain: We are using kanban for this purpose, as with kanban it is very clean to begin with and you do not clutter things up.
